# multi_roblox_macos

#### Info
Alright, first commit! Here it goes.
So.. This project simply allows you to "destroy" Roblox semaphore on Darwin system.
Simplier explanation is "yeah, you can open multiple roblox instance on MacOs now".

I'll probably edit readme later, rn feel exhausted as if I did coke all night (I didn't).
